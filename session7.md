# Session Seven: Test!

##Session Goal: To Review our MVP prototype, and apply testing strategies to iterate on our work

##Session Schedule:
###Welcome
  - Review: Build

###Why We Test?
  Testing is meant two help answer the following questions:
  - What do I expect this app to do?
  - Does this app do what it's mean to do for *EVERYONE?*
  - What will stop this app from doing what I expect it to do? i.e. *How does one break the app*

###Intro to Test Strategies
  - Prototyping
  - BDD
    User Stories => Acceptance Criteria
    Scenarios: *Given, When, Then*
  - A/B Testing
  - Performance Testing

###Getting Feedback
  - Be neutral
  - Asking the right questions:
    - Ask your users to answer I like... I wish... What If...
  - Segment your feedback into 4 quadrants: Likes, Criticisms, Questions, Ideas

##Homework:
  - Test your MVP out on 2 audience members. Use a feedback method to document. make one change reflecting that feedback.
  - Continue building!
